RAIN version 2.1.11.0 Release Notes

is now available from the Unity Asset Store: http://u3d.as/cks


New to RAIN:
------------
We've made major changes to the RAIN Navigation System!  Here are some of the new features:
1) You may now parent RAIN AI components to game objects.
--- Parenting a NavMesh will cause the NavMesh to obey the transform of the parent object, even if the transform changes at runtime.  You may move an object that has a child NavMesh, and the NavMesh will move along with it.  You can also create Prefabs that include NavMeshes, then place and position those prefabs at runtime.
--- Parented Waypoints and Navigation Targets will also obey the transform of their parent.
--- Parented AI will move along surfaces using the Y up of the parent object and will also obey runtime changes to the object transform (sticking to rotating surfaces, etc.)

2) AI can move correctly on objects that are rotated with respect to the world axis.  You may create AI that walk along walls, on the ceiling, etc.  You may need to disable gravity on your AI in some cases and use a custom gravity script.

3) Several pathing methods have been obsoleted and/or updated.  If you need help updating custom code, post your requests on the Rival Theory forums: http://rivaltheory.com/forums/

4) Check the Rival Theory website for example projects demonstrating use of the Navigation Changes: http://rivaltheory.com/community/tutorials/
